In this challenge we are supposed to decrypt an encripted key using the same script to encript that key.

== Ascii table 

This is the table we are going to use to know which ascii character is being represented after the encryption.

So the first step is taking a normal value that repeats itself at characters, so we can identify a clue of how the encoding is taking place.

== Testing the script:

aaaaa To encrypt

abcdef Encrypted

Now we see how it works, depends on the position it gives us the "n" moved character, a in position 0 equal a, a in position 2 equals b because abcdefghijk..... etc so lets try to use the key given and return the character at n position at left.

9f2fe3b To encrypt

9g4ii8h Encrypted

As we know there are numbers, letters and especial characters, you should based the reverse encoding in the character position at the ascii table.
So here we go again.

== Final Comprobation

9f2fe3b9 To encrypt

9g4ii8h@ Encrypted

There we have the result key, so the decoded one is the password we need.
