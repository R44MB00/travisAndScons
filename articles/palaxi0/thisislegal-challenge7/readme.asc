. Now we found something to work on. Lets google the hint because for this i had no idea what i was looking for.

. Now is just a little bit of reading to understand where we should look at.

. So now after reading that first article we can understand the vulnerability of the that seb server extension made for microsoft. So let's apply the vulnerable path to our challenge.

. Now here we see the directory and there's a file that we can open, so clic it.

. Now we have the credentials, but wait there's still a hash to crack, so let's use our good friend john the ripper, for this example i use linux in a virtual machine so i can crack ease the password.

. First put the password into a txt then use john the ripper for taking down the hash stored in that txt as above. Of course i won't show my password, is your job to do it yourself. Now let's go back to the admin page login, put the credentials and log.
