=== Solution

There's something weird at the url

Look at the end where File = Files6/Welcome.txt so there's a clue of a path we should go to.
Then write http://canyouhack.it/Content/Challenges/Web/Files6/ and there we got the directory and there's the txt that the last page was showing to us.

Now there's another file in there so what we are going to so is load that file same way the first one was being loaded.
