= Overthewire Leviathan level 6-7

== Solution

So first we need to log in using the ssh

[source, bash]
----
ssh leviathan6@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org
----

That will ask for the password you supposly got at the past challenge.
Then we should see whats into the level we just log in.

Now there's an executable that will tell us what to do, sort of.

So now we know that there's a hint that we should use that executable with a 4 digit code, as there's a limited combinations let's try them all using bash

[source, bash]
----
for i in {0000..9999}; do  echo $i & ./leviathan6 $i ; done
----

With the code above we ensure that the digits all always 4 starting in 0000 allt he way to 9999.

Then we will get the combination that let us enter into the shell

And now is just looking into the path we were told to look for the passwords.

And that's it.
