= The dark side of the client

There are two important concepts at internet that work together to allow a
human (user) to connect to the network: the *Client* and the *Server*. The
Server is a machine that is powered-on all day and it's responsible for
receiving requests from any Client and send responses back in a fast way, and
the Client is normally operated by humans (users), and it's the one that send
the requests to the Servers while it waits for the timely response with
information.

== Security

Many Websites have a common vulnerability that allows the
validation of the information on the *Client* side, not on the *Server* side,
in other words, the Client has the privilege of manipulating essential
information within the site.

This is a serious security problem because *hackers* can use this vulnerability
in order to change important features and functionalities of the site or even
worse to compromise the server.
An old saying in the world of computer security tells us: *"never let the
information be validated only at the Client-side"* and also *"filter all the
possible Client-side inputs"*.
All the web developers must know this basic security concept in order to prevent
cyber-attacks from malicious people.

== Hack This site Realistic 1

This funny challenge is about a website that ranks *Rock/Metal* bands in a top
list. Our mission is to put a band that is lagging behind in the first place of
the ranking.

*_Figure1: Our target band is called Raging Inferno_*

So we have to level up the rating of the band, and apparently the
only way to do that is implementing the *voting system*.

But we don't have a *lifetime* to put thousands of votes, So we're going
to try to manipulate one vote by changing its value (client-side
manipulation).

In order to do that, we have to right-click on the voting system and
choose the Inspect Element option (Figure 2).

*_Figure1: Inspect Element in Mozilla Firefox_*

A new window is opened:

*_Figura3: Inspector window_*

We have to change the value of the option *1* (vote 1) and put a very large
value in order to level up the rating of the band:

image::./img3.png[]
*_Figura3: extremely large value_*

Next we have to click on the *vote!* button to send this value to the website,
if the website does not validate the information we've just sent, the rating
of our band will be Huge! and we'll pass this challenge.

To prevent the manipulation of the information by the users within any kind of
website, it is always strongly recommended to validate and filter the data that
users send.
