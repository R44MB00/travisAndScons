= Types of triangles

A triangle is a 3-sided polygon sometimes (but not very commonly) called the
trigon. Every triangle has three sides and three angles, some of which may be
the same. The sides of a triangle are given special names in the case of a right
triangle, with the side opposite the right angle being termed the hypotenuse
and the other two sides being known as the legs. All triangles are convex and
bicentric. That portion of the plane enclosed by the triangle is called the
triangle interior, while the remainder is the exterior.

An triangle is said to be acute if all three of its angles are all acute, a
triangle having an obtuse angle is called an obtuse triangle, and a triangle
with a right angle is called right. A triangle with all sides equal is called
equilateral, a triangle with two sides equal is called isosceles, and a
triangle with all sides a different length is called scalene. A triangle can be
simultaneously right and isosceles, in which case it is known as an isosceles
right triangle.

== Challenge CodeAbbey Pythagorean Theorem

On this task we need to tell, based on an algorithm if the triangle given is
right, acute or obtuse. For acute triangle its longest side is shorter than
hypotenuse should be, for obtuse triangle its longest side is longer than
hypotenuse should be and for right for obtuse triangle its longest side is the
same length as the hypotenuse.

On the first line we receive the number of test cases, on next lines the sides
of the triangles, with their longest side at the end. We need to answer with
letters if the triangle is Acute, Obtuse or Right.

Example:

input data:
3
6 8 9
9 12 15
16 12 22

answer:
A R O

=== Solution

We calculate first the hypotenuse with the first 2 sides

[source,ocaml]
----
let rec hypo a b = hypot a b;;
----

Then we compare with the longest side

[source,ocaml]
----
if float_of_int c > hy then
  Printf.printf "O "
else
  if float_of_int c < hy then
    Printf.printf "A "
  else
    Printf.printf "R "
----
