= CONSERVING YOUR IDENTITY IN A WEB SERVICE WORLD

In the digital era everything is or has a web application. Web apps are no
longer just about content delivery, they have evolved to solve complex business
needs and have become a mechanism for application integration. The
communication and integration of these applications is most commonly done
through Web Services (WS) and with the growing concern over cyber security
comes the need to securely communicate via WS.

WS-Security defines the basic mechanism for a secure message exchange. This
specification uses these base mechanisms and defines additional primitives and
extensions for security token exchange in order to enable the issuance and
dissemination of credentials within different domains. Pretty much all it does
is attach signatures, security tokens and headers to SOAP messages. Before two
parties can securely communicate, each party needs to determine if they can
"trust" the other. Trust is understood as the expression or relationship
between parties where one of them will believe statements or claims made by
another party. It is based on evidence, history, experience, documents and more
(WS-Trust 1.4, 2012). The two parties don't have to be in the same domain to
securely exchange messages, this is where a very important concept and the main
purpose of this articles comes up, WS-Federation.

== WS-Federation

A federation is a collection of security domains, more commonly known as
realms, that have established relationships in order to securely share
resources. A Resource Provider (RP) in one realm can provide authorized access
to a resource it manages based on claims about a principal, such as identity or
other distinguishing attributes, that are asserted by an Identity Provider in
another realm. Identity is verified and relationships established through the
exchange a security token. WS-Federation builds on the WS-Trust encapsulation
mechanism which allows protocol processing to remain indifferent to the type of
token being transmitted. The main purpose of establishing a federation is to
facilitate the use of security principal attributes across trust boundaries by
establishing a federation context for that principal. A Relying Party can then
use this context to grant or deny access to a given resource (Goodner et al,
2007).

Parties in a federation may have different policies for obtaining services.
Policies are established to set security requirements when accessing a certain
resource, hence assuring that my service or resource is only accessible to the
desired parties. In the same manner, different services may have different
policies within a party.

Federations must be established by organizations and then the participants of
the federation must publish and exchange configuration information by which
common services and the policies for accessing them can be identified.
WS-Federation can not happen until an organization decides to establish a
federation. This is usually done based on business or legal need, not a
technical one.

=== Key Concepts

==== Federation Metadata
Federation Metadata refers to all configuration information that allows a party
to identify common services within a federation and the respective policies in
place to access them. In web services this is seen in the form of metadata
documents that contain endpoint references, claims and security tokens required
to access them.

==== Authorization
WS-Federation defines an authorization model that allows the implementation of
any authorization service in order to provide a security token and make
decisions regarding the access to available services. Although an organization
can implement any authorization service they desire, a common model to interact
with the service is required.

=== Adding more Security
Within WS-Federation there are some concepts that allow an organization to
request additional information in order to authorize access to advanced
functionalities of a service, hence adding more security.

==== Attributes
A federation message may not always be sufficient to identify common services.
After an initial request to access a basic service is authenticated some
organizations may request additional information in order to grant access to
advanced functionalities. In some cases the advanced functionalities contain
sensitive information which can not be known to everyone. If an attacker is
familiar with the process flow and structure of other services, it will be a
lot easier to maliciously gain access to the sensitive information. Attributes
are additional information that is requested in order to authorize or deny
access to a certain service.

==== Pseudonym
Some organizations or individuals are very concerned with identity fraud. This
is a common risk in WS-Security but Federation also provides a concept that
protects the user's identity. If an attacker manages to obtain everything
needed to take over my identity in a certain context or scope, and pseudonyms
are not implemented, the attacker can then use my identity to access services
in another scope. A pseudonym is an attribute that provides alternate identity
and it can provide different pseudonyms for different scopes, making it very
difficult for the attacker to gain access to a resource in one context based on
my identity from a different context. This way, if there is a federation
between multiple organizations in which a sensitive service is published, in
the case that one organization is compromised, this in no way guarantees access
to the same service in the other contexts.

WS-Federation enables parties to issue and rely on information from other
members of federations and to broker trust and attributes across federations in
a secure way maintaining individual and business privacy. It integrates with
the WS-Security model to enable secure and reliable transactions between
parties within and across federations (IBM, 2007). WS-Federation is a very
important step in defining a comprehensive Web services security strategy.
