With the fast pace in which technology advances now a days and the many
different solutions that are offered to all types of users, enterprises across
all sectors are either in the cloud, transitioning to the cloud, or thinking
about making the idea of cloud a reality. Hospitals and healthcare providers
are no exception. The cloud provides near real time, accurate exchange of
information to support a variety of health care scenarios—which is the
objective of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
Act (HITECH Act), (Filkins, 2011).

The first steps hospitals took into migrating to the cloud was SaaS (Software
as a Service). "Saas is a way of delivering applications over the Internet as a
service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it
via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware
management" (Salesforce, 2016). Now we are one step further, the cloud.

Hospitals handle sensitive patient information and therefore have to abide by a
series of laws that were put in place in order to assure privacy, secure access
to that information and reduce fraud. Migrating to the cloud raises some
concerns regarding those exact issues. Since all healthcare organizations are
obligated to comply with these laws, the compliance it self not only brings the
biggest risks but also poses the biggest challenge, whether it be in a server
room down the hall or in the cloud.

Different countries have different laws in place that all look to achieve the
same objective but may differ in some aspects. In this article we will be
talking about the security risk implied in the transition of hospitals and
other healthcare organizations to the cloud but focused only on the United
States law and healthcare providers.

== Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)
The HITECH act was created in 2009 to stimulate the adoption of electronic
health records (EHR) and supporting technology in the United States. This act
stipulates that beginning in 2011, healthcare providers would be offered
financial incentives for demonstrating "meaningful use" of EHRs until 2015,
after which time penalties may be applied for failing to demonstrate such use
(Rouse, 2015).

== The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
The HIPPA act provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding
medical information. This is intended to guarantee the privacy of medical
information. This act is not directly related to HITECH but they both
reinforce each other in some aspects (Rouse, 2015).

== Compliance in the Cloud
Chris Bowen, founder of ClearDATA, says there are three main focus areas for
HIPAA and HITECH regulations related to technology:
1. Administrative controls: Policies must be in place to determine who has access
to what data.
2. Technical controls: Rules must be in place to secure data.
3. Physical controls: Standards for physical access to data and infrastructure
resources must be abided by (Butler, 2016).

With the right precautions all of these regulations can be met in a cloud
environment. The majority of public clouds now offer a monitoring and log
functionality. Within the functionality, depending on the cloud, you can also
set up alarms to flag and report any unusual activity. That covers the
administrative controls.
If the cloud you choose doesn't offer encryption then you aren't looking at the
right options. Clouds also offer the possibility to deploy virtual security
controls such as an IDS, a WAF or even a DLP. With all data encrypted in the
cloud and some security controls deployed, depending on your needs, you can
cover the technical controls.
Finally, most cloud providers offer assurances to customers regarding physical
access to the data centres hosting their clouds. In this case you are
transferring the risk to a third party but based on the SLA they are obligated
to meet and therefore satisfying the physical controls.

== Fraud and Cloud. Friends or foes?
Now that we can check off compliance we are left with fraud, the other big
risk. With the migration to the cloud, it is not only your application but also
your data that leaves your sight, which means it is no longer protected by
whatever perimeter protection you had previously set up. This combined with the
fact that cloud enables users to access information from various devices and
various locations makes identity and access management more challenging and
leaves room for fraud.

Medical identity fraud, which has affected an estimated 1.5 million Americans,
and Financial fraud, which is estimated at $5 billion annually only in New
York, are amongst the most popular types of fraud (Filkins, 2011).

In the cloud, identity becomes the key to maintaining security, visibility and
control (Filkins, 2011). To solve the identity and access management problem we
need to stop the proliferation of user credentials. When a system uses multiple
credentials for one user, the user tends to forget and lose them. A Single Sign
On (SSO) technology gives us a solution. A SSO in an authentication service
that allows a user to use one set of credential to access multiple
applications.

SSO on its own is not enough, audits are the Robin to our SSO Batman and the
periodic auditing of all accesses and critical transactions will complete the
battle against fraud. This by no means implies that a SSO service and audits
will guarantee that you are going to be fraud free, it is just a strong
strategy and a very good start.

"The allure of on-demand cloud services combined with advances in cloud
security have transformed the healthcare IT mindset from “Why move to the
public cloud?” to “What should we move, how do we do it?”" (ClearDATA, 2016).
