== Background:

[.step-list]
* *Given* The instruction: I heard you were good with computers, so I was
wondering if you could help me out.

I have come across a website that claims to make children's dreams come true,
and i've done a little research and found out its just a scam. The idea is that
you submit your letter to Santa. The top three letters will then win everything
on there list. But in fact the ranking is fixed and there is no way to win.

Can you please somehow change their homepage to the one supplied?
* *And* 2 links, the change that we need to make and the page to change
