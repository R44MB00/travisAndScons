[.step-list]
* As logged-in at https://www.hackthis.co.uk[HackThis]
* I want to solve the challenge https://www.hackthis.co.uk/levels/main/4[Main4]

== Background:

[.step-list]
* *Given* A credential to fill (username and password text-boxes)
* *Given* the hint: Sometimes extra hidden fields are added to the form which
contains extra information for the login script. Again this is very easy for
anyone to gain access to as it is clearly shown in the source code.

Sometimes these fields can contain very important information.

=== Scenario: look for the answer

[.step-list]

* *When* I take a look at the source code
* *And* I search for 'pass' on the code
* *And* I find a XML file
* *Then* I browse for the file
* *And* Find the username and password
