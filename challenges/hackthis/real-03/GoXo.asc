* I want to solve the challenge https://www.hackthis.co.uk/levels/real/3[real3]

== Background:

[.step-list]
* *Given* The instruction: A friend of yours is getting really annoyed with his school network, they have blocked all the fun stuff. He has found the administrator login page, he's looked through the source code but still doesn't know what to do. Help him out by gaining access to the right account to change the internet settings:
* *And* A link to a login page

=== Scenario: log into this page 

[.step-list]
* *Given* The login page
* *When* I take a look at the source code
* *And* I realize that a /login.js shows some decrypted credentials
* *When* I realize that this encryption is very uncommon, so I search another possible solution
* *And* I realize that a /members.js path also exists
* *Then* I should solve this level
