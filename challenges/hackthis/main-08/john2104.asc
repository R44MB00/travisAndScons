[.step-list]
* As logged-in at https://www.hackthis.co.uk[HackThis]
* I want to solve the challenge https://www.hackthis.co.uk/levels/main/8[Main8]

== Background:

[.step-list]
* *Given* A credential to fill (username and password text-boxes)
* *Given* The hint: The coder has made the same mistake as level 4 but this time
at least he has tried to protect the password. The password has been encrypted,
convert the binary into something that is easier for humans to read (base 16).
If you think you have the right answer but it isn't being accepted, submit your
answer in CAPITALS.

=== Scenario: look for the answer

[.step-list]
* *When* I take a look at the source code
* *And* I see the path to the secrets
* *When* I take this Binary message and change to decimal
* *And* Change decimal to ASCII
* *Then* I should find the username and the password
