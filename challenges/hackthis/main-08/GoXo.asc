* As logged-in at https://www.hackthis.co.uk[HackThis]
* I want to solve the challenge https://www.hackthis.co.uk/levels/main/8[Main8]

== Background:

[.step-list]
* *Given* The hint: The coder has made the same mistake as level 4 but this time at least he has tried to protect the password. The password has been encrypted, convert the binary into something that is easier for humans to read (base 16).
If you think you have the right answer but it isn't being accepted, submit your answer in CAPITALS.

=== Scenario: look for the answer 

[.step-list]
* *Given* A credential to fill (username and password text-boxes)
* *When* I take a look at the source code
* *And* I see the path to the solution
* *Then* I should find an encrypted message
* *When* I take this Binary message
* *And* I convert it into another numeric system
* *Then* I should find the username and the password
