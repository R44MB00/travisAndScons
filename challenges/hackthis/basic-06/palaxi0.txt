Basic 6

So here we are given an encrypted key so we need to find out what was encrypted to generate this key. First we will try a basic combination to see how the encryption script works. 
aaaaa
abcdef

Now we see how it works, depends on the position it gives us the "n" moved character, a in position 0 equal a, a in position 2 equals b because abcdefghijk..... etc so lets try to use the key given and return the character at n position at left.

9f2fe3b decrypted
9g4ii8h encrypted

As we know there are numbers, letters and especial characters, you should based the reverse encoding 
9f2fe3b9
9g4ii8h@
