= Challengeland Programming 4

== Explanation

There's an url where we need to make a request to know what the challenge is about.

So making the request we know that there's a list of numbers we should get and send them in ascending order to the other url.

== Solution

This is a solution in Javascript.

[source, javascript]

$.ajax({url: "Challenges/Programming/2d7671805bRequest", method: "GET", success: function(e) {
	a = e.match(/-?\d+/g).join(",");
	total = a.split(",").map(Number).sort().join(",")
	console.log(e);
	console.log(total);
$.ajax({url: "Challenges/Programming/2d7671805bResponse", method: "Post", data: {solve: total}, success: function(e) { 
	console.log(e);
	} });
} });
