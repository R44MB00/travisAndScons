= Over the wire Bandit 3-4

For this set of wargames i used linux in a virtual machine so i can do it ease.

== Solution

Same as always, ssh log using ssh so "ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org" and password we got from last level. Now when we use "ls" we see that this time there is a directory in there called "inhere" so let's follow that "cd inhere/" and "ls" again, there's nothing, but there's always something that linux by default wont show us, the hidden files which starts with "." so using "ls -a" we are allowed to see all files including the hidden ones. Now open the "." file with "cat ./.hidden"
