* As logged-in user at https://www.hackthissite.org/[HackThisSite]
* I want to solve the challenge https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/application/[application1]

== Background:

[.step-list]
* *Given* An executable file called app1win.exe

=== Scenario: opening the file with OllyDbg
[.step-list]
* *Given* The OllyDbg framework (Binary code analysis program)
* *When* I open the executable file with OllyDbg
* *And* I search for all the intermodular calls
* *When* I find the call that compares two strings
* *And* I toggle a breakpoint at this call
* *Then* I should execute the file with the breakpoint toggled

=== Scenario: running the file with OllyDbg
[.step-list]
* *Given* OllyDbg environment with the breakpoint toggled
* *When* the program stops at the breakpoint
* *And* I see the string compared to the password
* *Then* I should solve this challenge
